    agile:
        apply lean poppeindieck//// done via wiki https://github.com/ghasan-yousef/secure-password-manager/wiki/MVP-definition
        use user stories//// done via issues https://github.com/ghasan-yousef/secure-password-manager/issues
        use scrum
        use kanban

### User Stories
All MVP features are tracked as GitHub Issues. Each issue includes:
- A clear user story
- Acceptance criteria
- Labels for filtering (`data access`, `feature`, `security`, etc.)

### Sprint Planning
Currently working through two sprints:
- **Sprint 1**: Authentication, encryption, and database setup
- **Sprint 2**: Credential management (Add, Edit, Retrieve, Delete)
